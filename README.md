# PloidyVariation

Bayesian Model Selection for determining best model to fit stochastic variation in ploidy (# of chromosomes) observed in Cyanobacteria.

Here are included various modules for inferring Lagrange Multipliers (LMs) from partial data, and then attempting to see how well these LMs produce synthetic data with the characteristics of the full experimental data. We use the Bayesian Information Criterion to quantify the quality of the fit of each model.
